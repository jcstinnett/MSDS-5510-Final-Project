# MSDS-5510-Final-Project
This project uses the product classification and clustering dataset found in the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/837/product+classification+and+clustering) to explore unsupervised learning techniques.

Specifically, the project compares the performance of KMeans clustering and Topic Modeling (Non-negative Matrix Factorization) when grouping product titles into clusters.
